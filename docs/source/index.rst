Welcome to Entity Authority Tool Set's documentation!
=====================================================

EATS is a web application for recording, editing, using and displaying
authority information about entities. It is designed to allow for
multiple authorities to each maintain their own independent data,
while operating on a common base that means information about the same
entity is all in one place.

EATS also comes with client tools for automatically looking up
entities by name and adding TEI markup.

A couple of papers, based on an old version of EATS but still largely
applicable, are: `An introduction to EATS`_ and `Topic Maps and Entity
Authority Records: an Effective Cyber Infrastructure for Digital
Humanities`_.
