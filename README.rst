EATS
====

EATS (the Entity Authority Tool Set) is a web application for
recording, editing, using and displaying authority information about
entities. It is designed to allow for multiple authorities to each
maintain their own independent data, while operating on a common base
that means information about the same entity is all in one place.

EATS also comes with client tools for automatically looking up
entities by name and adding TEI markup to those names.
