<p>Names are often broken into parts, such as given names, family
names, patronymics, etc. If it is desirable to record names explicitly
divided into these parts, create a name part type for each such.</p>

<p>If name part types are created, it is important to remember to
associate them with the appropriate languages, in the languages
section.</p>
