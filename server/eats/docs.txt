The topic map that is used by the EATS application is specified in the
settings file, giving the IRI of the topic map. If that topic map does
not exist, it will automatically be created (or an error thrown?).

EATS views are written with the assumption that
'django.middleware.transaction.TransactionMiddleware' is specified in
settings.py MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.

Refactor edit_entity template to use an include tag to handle error
messages, rather than repeating the HTML. This is dependent on being
able to write

 {% include "error_snippet.html" with errors=form.authority.errors only %}

Each name and name part is a topic, with the name itself stored in
that topic's (sole non-admin) name. The name entity API should hide
this implementation detail, allowing the changing of the name type and
name value without getting the Name instance.
