The topic map that is used by the EATS application is specified in the
settings file, giving the IRI of the topic map. If that topic map does
not exist, it will automatically be created (or an error thrown?).

EATS views are written with the assumption that
'django.middleware.transaction.TransactionMiddleware' is specified in
settings.py MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.
